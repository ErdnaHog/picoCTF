## Initial Thought Process + Why didn't it work + Solution:

Tried to see if there is something called tapping encryption got tap code. Next, tried to find if theres something called tap code and hyphen. Found something called Pollux Cipher which wasnt the one but saw morse code. (I heard this somewhere when my friend was discussing but I didnt find out what it was)
