## Initial Thought Process + Why didn't it work + Solution:

I attempted this twice, first time I tried many ways and forgot cause I didnt document so the second time I looked at the hint and it said "You do not need to download a new browser" I tried to search what is a picobrowser. Only saw write ups at the headline so I did not find anything useful. I tried to find something related to user agent and tried to find if I could find out how to change user agent of my browser.
