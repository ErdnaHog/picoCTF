## Learning takeaway:

Base64 a form of encoding raw binary data.

Base64 encoding would break binary data into 6-bits segment of 3 full bytes and represent those as printable characters in ASCII standard. Base 64 only uses 64 characters= 2^6 (hence 6 bits) to ensure encoded data is printable and humanly readable. Characters used are 0-9, A-Z, a-z, + and /. It will use a base64 index table to get the ASCII character.
