## Title:

Lets Warm Up

## Description:

If I told you a word started with 0x70 in hexadecimal, what would it start with in ASCII?

## Solution :![ascii table](.\ascii table.png)

from this image, we can see 0x70 represents 'p' in ascii. Flag: picoCTF{p}

## Learning takeaway:

For characters 0 to 9 their hexadecimal representation is 0x30 to 0x39

For characters A to Z it is 0x41 to 0x5A and a to z it is 0x61 to 7a. This is because the corresponding upper and lower case characters are 26 + 6 (special characters) apart
